<h1>201 -Class 03- HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model </h1>

<p>Similar to a list , we hold data with arrays.<br>
it is important to keep arrays in same file as JS unless you have a large amount of data and it makes sense to put it in its own JS file.</p>

<h2>CONDITIONALS</h2>
<h2>Arrays </h2>
<br>
This is an example of an *array*
```
let myName ="femi"; 
let myAge = 30;
let myList = ["femi",30,"anything"];
myArray[1]
console.log(myArray);
```
-  **would log 30 because index starts at 0 and 30 would be 1**

<h2>An array inside an array </h2>
 OR mixed array)

```
let myArray = [
"femi" ,  // item 0
30,  //item 1
"anything", //item 2
["tino"//0, 22//0 , "Russel//2"]
];
let ouput = [myArray[3][2]);

console.log(output);
```

//the whole item of the new array is index 3
// to get the word russel the second item would be

_Flex Box_
Flexbox allows you to create a flexible column or row in the UI using Axis
example:

<img src="img/some of 4 and 7 .png">
