<h2>**USING THE TERMINAL - Linux**</h2>

Within a **_terminal_** you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

<h2>Setting up a Git Repository</h2>

A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. 

Setting up a Git repository can be confusing at first but when you learn the commands to enter into the terminal, type them over and over, repeat them first without understanding their significance but after a few days your muscle memory takes over and \*by gum you've got it'. Really, it is simple when broken down into **A** **C** **P**, otherwise known as <br>
```
git add .
git commit
git push
```

> Before we go on to explain the process of setting up a Repository. Let us not confuse _Git_ with _Github_ - That's important.

> > Git: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

<h2> Okay, now here is how to set up a Git Repository on Github.</h2>
<h3>*Let*'s go.<h3> This is a pun, it'll make sense later. :EMOJICODE:triangular_flag_on_post:

After setting up your Github account (Link to Github: [Github](https://www.https://github.com/).

A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

Developers can review project history to find out:

+Which changes were made?
+Who made the changes?
+When were the changes made?
+Why were changes needed?
