**A _Growth mindset_ is...**
- Believing in yourself to learn something new
* Persevering with the task or project, gaining confidence through learning from challenges and gainging self empowerment. 
+ Changing a *I cant do this* attitude to a **I can do anything** attitude with a blend of creativity and determination.
