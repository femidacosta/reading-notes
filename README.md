## Hi my name is Femi. I am studying software development.

My interests are exploring new music *(always open for suggestions)* and creating artwork through visualising sound, I also like researching innovative ideas within science, technology and architecture that positively impact humanity. 

## What is this website?

This website shows my reading notes for the full stack bootcamp. I have completed the first module called 102, please click the links in the navigation to view my notes.

**A _Growth mindset_ is...** believing in your ability to keep learning through perseverance and motivation. Through assessing your progress you are able to grow in not only confidence but self empowerment, which begins a positively perpetual cycle of persistence and understanding of the balance between effort and success.

The growth mindset can be explained by the changing of a *I cant do this* attitude to a **I can do anything** attitude with a blend of creativity,determination and the love for learning something new and exciting.

For example;
- [x] Begin Full Stack Bootcamp 
- [ ] Learn a programming Language
- [ ] Take the time to reflect on your effort
- [ ] Learn another...programming Language
- [ ] Do a motivational dance <sup> / whatever works for you </sup>
- [ ] Feel good about your progress, the connections you have made in your brain and with others on the course :tada:
