## Hi my name is Femi. I am learning to code.
My interests are exploring new music *(always open for suggestions)* and creating artwork through visualising sound, I also like reserching innovative ideas within science, technology and architecture that positively impact humanity. I really enjoy collaborating with people in all different types of projects.

**A _Growth mindset_ is...**
- Believing in yourself to learn something new
* Persevering with the task or project, gaining confidence through learning from challenges and gainging self empowerment. 
+ Changing a *I cant do this* attitude to a **I can do anything** attitude with a blend of creativity and determination.

For example;
- [x] Begin Full Stack Bootcamp 
- [ ] Learn a programming Languauge
- [ ] Take the time to reflect on your effort
- [ ] Learn another...programming Languauge
- [ ] Do a motivational dance <sup> / whatever works for you </sup>
- [ ] Feel good about your progress, the connections you have made in your brain and with others on the course:tada:
